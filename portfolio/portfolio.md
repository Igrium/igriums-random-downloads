## Hard-Surface Modeling

I've been using Blender since I was in sixth grade, and I've gotten quite adept at hard-surface modeling. You may have seen some models floating around the community, the most popular of which is a high-quality portal gun model:

Most of my other models can be found on my [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/Sam54123).

## Quanta Collective

I'm a hard-surface modeler at Quanta Collective, a team trying to re-create Portal 2 in S&Box. While development has slowed down due to the *massively* unstable API (do we *really* need to be removing the entire entity system garry?), I've made many high-quality assets for them.

## Blender Art

In addition to standalone models, I also create posters in Blender from time to time, which can be found on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/igrium/gallery).

## *The Intruder*  (Portal 2)

A little over a year ago, I published my Portal 2 map, *[The Intruder](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2771293139).* It is widely regarded as one of the best Portal 2 maps of 2022. At first, it tricks the player into thinking it's a normal PTI map. Over time, however, the puzzle is interrupted by odd, supernatural occurrences until evolves into a full-on psychological horror map.

This project was six months in the making, and it pushes the Source engine to its very limits. It has three thousand subscribers on Steam and it was featured as Map of the Month on the Thinking with Portals discord. It's what got me accepted in to the Portal 2: Community Edition closed beta and the S&Box developer preview.
